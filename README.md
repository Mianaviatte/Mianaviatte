Nice to e-meet you.

I have C2 Proficient English level; starter's kit of learning Python 3.5+, Git and OOP principals; a bit of HTML and CSS experience; deep knowledge in Scrum and Kanban methodologies; PM practice in Jira and Confluence, all will be useful for you.

For 10 years I had a dream to become a Python Engineer. Now I finally started learning python for several months. 
In my previous jobs as chief editor of corporate blogs about project management (Scrum, Kanban, Agile, pair programming, etc) I have been working with HTML and CSS to fix issues with content formatting.

You can check up my old CV Landing Page here: http://mianaviatte.tilda.ws/  
I made and updated it numerous times, on my own, via Tilda.

CV is more about Product Marketing and SaaS Business Consulting. The thing is, I wish to move from Business management and Advertising to Software Development (starting) with Python for good.

I have huge experience in SaaS development but on the marketing and business development side. For the last few years, got burnt out of marketing. Now I'm a Junior Python Engineer.
